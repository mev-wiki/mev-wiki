During this period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool called the mempool where contents are visible to everyone. Arbitrageurs and miners can monitor the mempool and find opportunities to maximize their own profits e.g. by frontrunning transactions. If a front-runner is a miner, they can also reorder or even censor transactions. MEV income can also be shared with non miners & traders who participate in some profit sharing schemes within the category of [FaaS/MEVA](solutions/faas-or-meva/).\n\n<br />\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-question.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" /> Why does this matter[¹](https://research.paradigm.xyz/MEV)?\n\n### MEV can harm users\n\nMEV is an invisible tax that miners can collect from users.\n\n### MEV can destabilize Ethereum\n\nIf block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus by reordering or censoring transactions.\n\n<br />\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-question.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" /> Just how bad is the problem? <a href=\"#just-how-bad-is-the-problem\" id=\"just-how-bad-is-the-problem\" />\n\nYou can use the [Flashbots Dashboard ](https://explore.flashbots.net/)to track Extracted MEV to better assess this worsening trend realtime.\n\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Snapshot of Extracted MEV on 28 Sep 2021 from Flashbots\" src={__img0} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n  <figcaption>Snapshot of Extracted MEV on 28 Sep 2021 from Flashbots</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIt is estimated that more than $727M of MEV has been extracted since 1st January 2020.\n\n<figure>\n    <img alt=\"Snapshot of Extracted MEV Split on 28 Sep 2021 from Flashbots\" src={__img1} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n  <figcaption>Snapshot of Extracted MEV Split on 28 Sep 2021 from Flashbots</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe majority of extracted MEV tend to be from [Arbitrage](terms-and-concepts/arbitrage) opportunities on various [AMMs](terms-and-concepts/automated-market-maker), with a large percentage of income going to searchers, bots & participants in profit sharing MEV infrastructures (eg.

The bot swoops in and buys as many tokens as possible (but not all of them as there needs to be an opportunity for others to buy tokens as well).The bot then waits for the price to go up as other traders buy the token from Uniswap and proceeds to sell back the tokens at a higher price.

If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus.\n\nImagine there are two miners, Sam and Dan, who are paid a $100 reward for each block they find. Sam has found 3 blocks, the first of which contained a $10,000 arbitrage opportunity.\n\nNow Dan has a choice: he can either mine on top of Sam’s 3 blocks, or he can attempt to re-mine the first block in order to take the Uniswap arbitrage for himself. The $10,000 is much more lucrative than the $100 block reward, and Dan is more rational than honest, so he decides to re-mine the first block. While Dan’s at it, since the current longest chain is height 3, he also re-mines the second and third blocks (and captures any MEV that was in those, too). After the re-organization, Dan owns the longest chain and he and Sam can progress from the third block.\n"},{"path":"/attack-examples/uncle-bandit-attack","markdown":"# Uncle bandit attack\n\n## Overview\n\nBundles are groups of transactions Flashbots users submit. Those transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. A bundle should never be split up.\n\nRobert Miller found that for a specific bundle, only the \"Buy\" part of a sandwich bundle submitted had landed on-chain, and right after that Buy someone else had inserted a 7 gas transaction that arbitraged it.\n\nHow?\n\nIn Ethereum occasionally two blocks are mined at roughly the same time, and only one block can be added to the chain. The other gets \"uncled\" or orphaned. Anyone can access transactions in an uncled block and some of the transactions may not have ended up in the non-uncled block. In a way some transactions end up in a sort of mempool like state: they are now public as a part of the uncled block and perhaps still valid too.\n\nA Sandwicher's bundle was included in an uncled block. An attacker saw this, grabbed only the Buy part of the Sandwich, threw away the rest, and added an arbitrage after. The attacker then submitted that as a bundle, which was then mined.\n\nInstead of seeing something late in time and rewinding it (time-bandit attack), the uncle bandit attack is when an attacker sees something in an uncle and brings it forward. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  [https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339?s=20](https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1382673587715342339?s=20)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots","markdown":"# Attempts to trick the bots\n\n## Various methods to trick MEV bots\n\n<Cards cols={1}>\n  <Card title=\"Salmonella\" href=\"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots/salmonella\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Kattana\" href=\"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots/kattana\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Other attempts\" href=\"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots/other-attempts-to-trick-the-bot\" />\n</Cards>\n"},{"path":"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots/kattana","markdown":"# Kattana\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Kattana team included a trap for front-running bots during their token listing.

Miners receive bundles of transaction from users and include the bundle that pays them the most. Users love this because they only pay for transactions that are included and they can determine the fee that they are going to pay.\n\nSandwich bots watch the mempool for users buying on DEXes and sandwich them: running the price up before the victim buys and dumping after for a profit. Those 3 txs (buy, victim transaction, sell) make up a bundle. Note the Sandwich sell transaction contains the smart contract payment to the miner. It's important that payment goes to the miner on the sell transaction! That should only happen after the bot has secured profit from selling the tokens bought in their front-run. If that sell fails then there is no payment to the miner, and thus their bundle shouldn't be included\n\nTo be even more secure, bots will simulate their transactions on local infrastructure. Bots won't send transactions unless the simulation goes well. Paying transaction fees only on the sell transaction of a sandwich should defend against this. No profit, no payment.\n\n## Simulation vs Reality <a href=\"#simulation-vs-reality\" id=\"simulation-vs-reality\" />\n\nSome really smart people found weaknesses among all of these defenses.\n\nThe first defense was that simulation was done with an ERC20 transfer function that checked to see if the block was a mined by Flashbots' miners, and if so it transfers way less out. Local simulations look fine but do not work in production.\n\n## The second defense - Payment only on a sell transaction <a href=\"#the-second-defense-payment-only-on-a-sell-transaction\" id=\"the-second-defense-payment-only-on-a-sell-transaction\" />\n\nAgain: Sandwich bots make miner payment conditional on profit. That was broken by making the ERC20 token pay the miner. Thus even with the Sandwich bot sell failing, the miner would still get paid!\n\nHere's what actually happened: Sandwich bot gets baited and buys 100 ETH of the poisonous token. Poisonous token owner's bait triggers custom transfer function, which pays 0.1 ETH to the miner Sandwich bot's sell doesn't work because of the poisonous token. As the sandwich bot submitted these three transactions in a bundle all three were included: the successful buy, the bait, and the failed sell. The poisonous ERC20's payment via the custom transfer was what incentivized a miner to include it!\n\nIt is estimated that the first person to do this made about 100 ETH. You can see the poisoned ERC20 Uniswap transactions [here ](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe253a1f7d5818022661bfbd2cbe043b642b4eff9?a=0x01f8d5a4862d51d2cf0cf52ac900a4d60adaeee6).\n\n## From Victim to Predator <a href=\"#from-victim-to-predator\" id=\"from-victim-to-predator\" />\n\nOne of their victims was one the most successful Flashbots bot operators, and they immediately sprung into action. In a short period of time the victim turned into an apex predator. They launched a similar but slightly different ERC20 (YOLOchain), and ended up successfully baiting many more sandwichers. They made 300 ETH doing so!\n"},{"path":"/attempts-to-trick-the-bots/salmonella","markdown":"# Salmonella\n\n## How It Works\n\nSalmonella intentionally exploits the generalised nature of front-running setups. The goal of sandwich trading is to exploit the slippage of unintended victims, so this strategy turns the tables on the exploiters. It's a regular ERC20 token, which behaves exactly like any other ERC20 token in normal use-cases. However, it has some special logic to detect when anyone other than the specified owner is transacting it, and in these situations it only returns 10% of the specified amount - despite emitting event logs which match a trade of the full amount.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Link:** [https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella](https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions","markdown":"# Solutions\n\n## Different approaches to tackling the MEV problem <a href=\"#different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem\" id=\"different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem\" />\n\nThere are largely 2 schools of thought when it comes to approaching the MEV problem\n\n1. <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" style={{display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: '0.25rem'}} /> **Offense** - MEV is here to stay so let's find a way to extract and democratize it.\n2. <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" style={{display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: '0.25rem'}} /> **Defense** - MEV is bad so let's try to prevent it.\n\nProjects like Automata Network are in the Defense camp where the solution [Conveyor](https://docs.ata.network/mev/solutions/mev-minimization-prevention/#conveyor-the-automata-network-approach-to-tackling-mev) ingests transactions and outputs transactions in a determined order.

Contrary to traditional limit order-book-based exchanges (which maintain a list of bids and asks for an asset pair), AMM exchanges maintain a pool of capital (a liquidity pool) with at least two assets. A smart contract governs the rules by which traders can purchase and sell assets from the liquidity pool. The most common AMM mechanism is a constant product AMM, where the product of an asset X and asset Y in a pool have to abide by a constant K.\n\nExamples of AMM Exchanges include [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/), [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap).\n"},{"path":"/terms-and-concepts/defi","markdown":"# DeFi\n\n## Definition\n\nDeFi is a subset of finance-focused decentralized protocols that operate autonomously on blockchain-based smart contracts.

This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.\n\n<img alt=\"\" src={__img0} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n\nWhen transactions are fed into Conveyor, it determines the order of the incoming transactions and makes it impossible for block producers to perform the following:\n\n1. Inject new transactions into the Conveyor output: The inserted transactions bypassing Conveyor is detectable by anyone because of signature mismatch.\n2. Delete ordered transactions: Transactions accepted by Conveyor are broadcasted everywhere so transactions cannot be deleted unless ALL block producers are colluding and censoring the transactions at the same time.\n\nFrom the DEX’s perspective, they can choose to accept either\n\n1.

Each Geode instance can be attested so anyone can publicly verify that the Geode is running on a system with genuine hardware (i.e., CPU) and that the Geode application code matches the version that is open-sourced and audited. This provides a strong guarantee that:\n\n* The Geode code is untampered with\n* The Geode data is inaccessible to even Geode providers (In which case they cannot act on said data to front-run transactions)\n\nImportantly, Automata’s Conveyor is a chain-agnostic solution to the MEV issue, and works seamlessly on various platforms — zero modifications needed.\n\n#### An industry-first: Oblivious RAM <a href=\"#an-industry-first-oblivious-ram\" id=\"an-industry-first-oblivious-ram\" />\n\nIn fully public computation, access pattern leakage is not negligible as everything is exposed. But in privacy-preserving computation, any tiny bit of information leakage becomes a significant issue. Studies have shown that access pattern leakage leads to exposure of sensitive information such as private keys from searchable encryption and trusted computing.\n\nThis is where the Oblivious RAM algorithm comes into play. Automata’s implementation is the first-of-its-kind in the blockchain industry, providing an exceedingly high degree of privacy in dApps.\n\nThis greatly reduces the probability of user privacy being leaked even as access patterns are being monitored and analyzed by malicious actors. The Automata team has authored multiple research papers on state-of-the-art ORAM and hardware technologies to enhance the privacy and performance of existing networks.\n\n* Robust P2P Primitives Using SGX Enclaves [RAID 2020](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/raid20-jia.pdf)\n* PRO-ORAM: Practical Read-Only Oblivious RAM [RAID 2019](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/raid2019-tople.pdf)\n* OblivP2P: An Oblivious Peer-to-Peer Content Sharing System [USENIX Security 2016](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_jia.pdf)\n* Preventing Page Faults from Telling Your Secrets [Asia CCS 2016](https://n.ethz.ch/~sshivaji/publications/pfdefense_asiaccs16.pdf)\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Official Links**\\\n  Website: [https://ata.network/](https://ata.network/) \\\n  Whitepaper: [https://xata.to/lightpaper](https://xata.to/lightpaper) \\\n  GitHub: [https://xata.to/github](https://xata.to/github) \\\n  Documentation: [https://docs.ata.network/](https://docs.ata.network/) \\\n  Ambassador program form: [https://xata.to/ambassadors](https://xata.to/ambassadors) \\\n  FAQ: [https://xata.to/faq](https://xata.to/faq) \\\n  \\\n  **Official Socials** \\\n  Telegram Annoucement Channel: [https://t.me/ata\\_announcement](https://t.me/ata_announcement) \\\n  Telegram Chat Group: [https://xata.to/telegram](https://xata.to/telegram) \\\n  Twitter: [https://xata.to/twitter](https://xata.to/twitter) \\\n  Discord: [https://xata.to/discord](https://xata.to/discord) \\\n  Medium: [https://xata.to/medium](https://xata.to/medium) \\\n  \\\n  **Community Links** \\\n  Korea (Telegram): [https://t.me/atanetworkkorea](https://t.me/atanetworkkorea)\\\n  Spain (Telegram): [https://t.me/atanetworkspanish](https://t.me/atanetworkspanish)\\\n  Sri Lanka (Telegram): [https://t.me/atanetworksinhala](https://t.me/atanetworksinhala)\\\n  Russian (Telegram): [https://t.me/atanetworkrussia](https://t.me/atanetworkrussia)\\\n  Malay-Indonesian (Telegram): [https://t.me/atanetworkmalaysia](https://t.me/atanetworkmalaysia)\\\n  \\\n  **Other useful links**\\\n  MEV Checkup Tool: [https://mev.tax/](https://mev.tax/) \\\n  Coinmarketcap article: [https://xata.to/vxa](https://xata.to/vxa) \\\n  Binance research report: [https://xata.to/br](https://xata.to/br) \\\n  Binance launchpool annoucement: [https://xata.to/186e34](https://xata.to/186e34)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/mev-minimization/cowswap","markdown":"# CowSwap\n\n## <img src=\"/images/icon-defense-shield.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" />CowSwap\n\nA collaboration between BalancerLabs and Gnosis, CowSwap is a DEX that leverages batch auctions to provide MEV protection, plus integrate with liquidity sources across DEXs to offer traders the best prices. When two traders each hold an asset the other wants, an order can be settled directly between them without an external market maker or liquidity provider. Any excess is settled in the same transaction with the best available AMM. The transaction is sent by professional “solvers” which set tight slippage bounds.

Oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it.\n\nFSS is a framework for implementing ordering policies, of which [Aequitas](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf) (protocol for order-fairness in addition to consistency and liveness) is one example. It can alternatively support simpler approaches, such as straightforward encryption of transactions, which can then be decrypted in a threshold manner by oracle nodes after ordering. It will also support various policies for inserting oracle reports into a stream of transactions. (It can even support MEV auctions, if desired.)\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Links:**\n\n  * Blog post: [https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/)\n  * Whitepaper (to be released later)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/mev-minimization","markdown":"# MEV Minimization\n\n## Various solutions in MEV minimization\n\n<Cards cols={1}>\n  <Card title=\"Conveyor (Automata Network)\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/conveyor-automata-network\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"SecretSwap (Secret Network)\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/secretswap-secret-network\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Fair Sequencing Service (Chainlink)\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/fair-sequencing-service-chainlink\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Arbitrum (Offchain Labs)\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/arbitrum-offchain-labs\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Vega protocol\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/vega-protocol\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"CowSwap\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/cowswap\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Veedo (StarkWare)\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/veedo-starkware\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"LibSubmarine\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/libsubmarine\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Sikka\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/sikka\" />\n\n  <Card title=\"Shutter Network\" href=\"/solutions/mev-minimization/shutter-network\" />\n</Cards>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/mev-minimization/libsubmarine","markdown":"# LibSubmarine\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" />LibSubmarine\n\nLibSubmarine is an open-source smart contract library that protects your contract against front-runners by temporarily hiding transactions on-chain.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Links:**\n\n  * Website: [https://libsubmarine.org/](https://libsubmarine.org/)\n  * Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8PDKoptmPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8PDKoptmPs\\&feature=emb_imp_woyt\\&ab_channel=IC3InitiativeforCryptocurrenciesandContracts)\n  * GitHub: [https://github.com/lorenzb/libsubmarine](https://github.com/lorenzb/libsubmarine)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/mev-minimization/secretswap-secret-network","markdown":"# SecretSwap (Secret Network)\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" />Secret Swap\n\nSecret Swap is an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity protocol. There is no orderbook, no centralized party, and no central facilitator of trade. Using Secret Contracts, the mempool of potential Secret Swap transactions are kept entirely encrypted - protecting users from MEV, front-running attacks and providing an increased level of privacy compared to traditional AMMs.\n\nThe protocol uses swap secret contract based tokens (SNIP-20s) on Secret Network. Given the encrypted nature of SNIP-20s secret contracts, inputs to a transaction/contract are encrypted while they are on the mempool and cannot be front-run by any adversary. Users will have to pay for gas and 0.3% swap fees with the $SCRT token to use Secret Swap.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Links:**\n\n  * Website: [https://www.secretswap.io](https://www.secretswap.io/faq)\n  * Analytics: [http://secretanalytics.xyz](http://secretanalytics.xyz/)\n  * Documentation: [https://docs.secretswap.io/secretswap](https://docs.secretswap.io/secretswap/)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/mev-minimization/shutter-network","markdown":"# Shutter Network\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" />Shutter Network\n\nShutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent frontrunning and malicious MEV on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.\n\nA Shutter transaction is a transaction protected from frontrunning in the target smart contract system.

Vega's proposal is to add a module to blockchains that supports the concept of relative fairness so that competing transactions may be sequenced under a known and understood protocol, and not subject to a validator’s discretion.\n\n\"*If there is a time t such that all honest validators saw a before t and b after t, then a must be scheduled before b”.* This is a property that can be assured of at any time with a minimal impact on performance.\n\nTo get the best combination, their current approach is a hybrid of the two. In normal operation, the protocol will assure block fairness. If the network detects that this causes a bottleneck, it temporarily switches to the timed approach (thus sacrificing a little fairness for performance), before switching back once the bottleneck is resolved. However, Vega will ultimately make the level of fairness customisable by market.\n\n<Callout type=\"info\">\n  **Links:**\n\n  * Website: [https://vega.xyz/](https://vega.xyz/)\n  * Blog: [https://blog.vega.xyz/new-paper-fairness-and-front-running-an-invitation-for-feedback-cbb39a1a3eb](https://blog.vega.xyz/new-paper-fairness-and-front-running-an-invitation-for-feedback-cbb39a1a3eb)\n  * Wendy, the Good Little Fairness Widget: [https://vega.xyz/papers/fairness.pdf](https://vega.xyz/papers/fairness.pdf)\n  * Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjfLj5fhkGQ\\&t=18s\\&ab\\_channel=VegaProtocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjfLj5fhkGQ\\&t=18s\\&ab_channel=VegaProtocol)\n</Callout>\n"},{"path":"/solutions/others/b.protocol","markdown":"# B.Protocol\n\n## <img src=\"/mev-wiki/images/icon-bprotocol.png\" alt=\"\" className=\"heading-icon\" /> B.Protocol <a href=\"#bprotocol\" id=\"bprotocol\" />\n\nB.Protocol aims to shift MEV to users.\n\nUsers interact with existing lending platforms via B.Protocol smart contract.
