## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-question.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" /> What is MEV?

Maximal (formerly "miner" in the context of Proof of Work) extractable value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by censoring and/or changing the order of transactions in a block.

When someone sends a transaction in the blockchain, there is a delay between the time when the transaction is broadcasted to the network and when it is actually mined into a block. During this period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool called the mempool where contents are visible to everyone. Arbitrageurs and miners can monitor the mempool and find opportunities to maximize their own profits e.g. by frontrunning transactions. If a front-runner is a miner, they can also reorder or even censor transactions. MEV income can also be shared with non miners & traders who participate in some profit sharing schemes within the category of [FaaS/MEVA](solutions/faas-or-meva/).

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-question.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" /> Why does this matter[¹](https://research.paradigm.xyz/MEV)?

### MEV can harm users

MEV is an invisible tax that miners can collect from users.

### MEV can destabilize Ethereum

If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus by reordering or censoring transactions.

The majority of extracted MEV tend to be from [Arbitrage](terms-and-concepts/arbitrage) opportunities on various [AMMs](terms-and-concepts/automated-market-maker), with a large percentage of income going to searchers, bots & participants in profit sharing MEV infrastructures (eg. [Flashbot's](solutions/faas-or-meva/flashbots) MEV-GETH)

Another useful tracker for gas consumption of back-running bots:  [Dune Analytics](https://duneanalytics.com/phabc/backrunning-bots-gas-consumption) provides very detailed statistics on this worsening MEV situation.

## What Happens when Ethereum moves to Proof-of-Stake? <a href="#what-happens-when-ethereum-moves-to-proof-of-stake" id="what-happens-when-ethereum-moves-to-proof-of-stake" />

The move from PoW to PoS consensus means the Ethereum network becomes secured by a set validators, who stake their ETH and vote on consensus, as opposed to miners who run mining equipment to solve for the proof of work. This change of consensus is set to happen likely some time in 2021. Some have suggested that this means Miner Extractable Value will become Validator Extractable Value.

From Paradigm's piece "On Staking Pools and Staking Derivatives" - Staking pools and their staking derivatives are subject to similar market realities as MEV extraction, in the sense that their existence is inevitable. Institutional staking pools (e.g. exchanges) may have social and reputational constraints that prevent them from extracting certain forms of MEV. This allows smaller staking firms and decentralized pools without these constraints to provide higher returns for their stakers. This could turn the decentralization premium for using a decentralized staking pool into a decentralization discount.

# Back-running

## Overview

Back-running occurs when a transaction sender wishes to have their transaction ordered immediately after some unconfirmed "target transaction".

Example: A back-running bot that back-runs new token listings. Bot monitors the Ethereum mempool for new pairs being created on Uniswap. If it finds a new pair the bot places a buy transaction immediately behind the initial liquidity. The bot swoops in and buys as many tokens as possible (but not all of them as there needs to be an opportunity for others to buy tokens as well).The bot then waits for the price to go up as other traders buy the token from Uniswap and proceeds to sell back the tokens at a higher price. The key in this strategy is to be the first to buy tokens, but only after the token has been launched[¹](https://amanusk.medium.com/the-fastest-draw-on-the-blockchain-bzrx-example-6bd19fabdbe1).

In order to maximise their chances of being mined immediately after their target, a typical backrunner will send many identical transactions, with gas price identical to that of the target transaction, sometimes from different accounts.

# Front-running

## Definition

Front-running is the process by which an adversary observes transactions on the network layer and then acts upon this information by, for instance, issuing a competing transaction, with the hope that this transaction is mined before a victim transaction e.g. Transaction A is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction B so that A gets mined before B.

# Liquidations

## Liquidation Strategies

Back-running strategies also apply to liquidations whereby a transaction sender wishes to be the first to liquidate a loan right after a price oracle update (which will allow liquidation to be triggered).

* Fixed spread liquidation used by Compound, Aave, and dYdX allows a liquidator to purchase collateral at a fixed discount when repaying debt.

<Tabs items={['Strategy 1', 'Strategy 2']}>
  <Tab value="Strategy 1">
    A detects a liquidation opportunity at block B (i.e., after the execution of B). A then issues a liquidation transaction T, which is expected to be mined in the next block B +1. A attempts to destructively front-run other competing liquidators by setting high transaction fees for his liquidation transaction T.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Strategy 2">
    A observes a transaction T, which will create a liquidation opportunity (e.g., an oracle price update transaction which will render a collateralized debt liquidatable). A then back-runs T with a liquidation transaction TA to avoid the transaction fee bidding competition.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

* The auction liquidation allows a liquidator to start an auction that lasts for a pre-configured period (e.g., 6 hours). Competing liquidators can engage and bid on the collateral price.


# Sandwich attack

## Attack Mechanism

Alice wants to buy a Token A on a Decentralised Exchange (DEX) that uses an automated market maker (AMM) model. An adversary which sees Alice's transaction can create two of its own transactions which it inserts before and after Alice's transaction (sandwiching it). The adversary's first transaction buys Token A, which pushes up the price for Alice's transaction, and then the third transaction is the adversary's transaction to sell Token A (now at a higher price) at a profit.


# Time bandit attack

## Overview

Time-bandit attacks are attacks where miners rewrite blockchain history to steal funds allocated by smart contracts in the past. If block rewards are small enough compared to MEV, it can be rational for miners to destabilize consensus.

Imagine there are two miners, Sam and Dan, who are paid a $100 reward for each block they find. Sam has found 3 blocks, the first of which contained a $10,000 arbitrage opportunity.

Now Dan has a choice: he can either mine on top of Sam’s 3 blocks, or he can attempt to re-mine the first block in order to take the Uniswap arbitrage for himself. The $10,000 is much more lucrative than the $100 block reward, and Dan is more rational than honest, so he decides to re-mine the first block. While Dan’s at it, since the current longest chain is height 3, he also re-mines the second and third blocks (and captures any MEV that was in those, too). After the re-organization, Dan owns the longest chain and he and Sam can progress from the third block.


# Uncle bandit attack

## Overview

Bundles are groups of transactions Flashbots users submit. Those transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. A bundle should never be split up.

Robert Miller found that for a specific bundle, only the "Buy" part of a sandwich bundle submitted had landed on-chain, and right after that Buy someone else had inserted a 7 gas transaction that arbitraged it.

How?

In Ethereum occasionally two blocks are mined at roughly the same time, and only one block can be added to the chain. The other gets "uncled" or orphaned. Anyone can access transactions in an uncled block and some of the transactions may not have ended up in the non-uncled block. In a way some transactions end up in a sort of mempool like state: they are now public as a part of the uncled block and perhaps still valid too.

A Sandwicher's bundle was included in an uncled block. An attacker saw this, grabbed only the Buy part of the Sandwich, threw away the rest, and added an arbitrage after. The attacker then submitted that as a bundle, which was then mined.

Instead of seeing something late in time and rewinding it (time-bandit attack), the uncle bandit attack is when an attacker sees something in an uncle and brings it forward. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.

# Kattana

## Overview

The Kattana team included a trap for front-running bots during their token listing. There is a line in the code that disallows the front-runner from selling all tokens. So a front-runner paid 68 ETH to the miner and ended up with tokens he wasn't able to sell.

## Background <a href="#background" id="background" />

Instead of users paying transaction fees via gas prices, Flashbots users pay fees via a smart contract call which transfers ETH to a miner. Miners receive bundles of transaction from users and include the bundle that pays them the most. Users love this because they only pay for transactions that are included and they can determine the fee that they are going to pay.

Sandwich bots watch the mempool for users buying on DEXes and sandwich them: running the price up before the victim buys and dumping after for a profit. Those 3 txs (buy, victim transaction, sell) make up a bundle. Note the Sandwich sell transaction contains the smart contract payment to the miner. It's important that payment goes to the miner on the sell transaction! That should only happen after the bot has secured profit from selling the tokens bought in their front-run. If that sell fails then there is no payment to the miner, and thus their bundle shouldn't be included

To be even more secure, bots will simulate their transactions on local infrastructure. Bots won't send transactions unless the simulation goes well. Paying transaction fees only on the sell transaction of a sandwich should defend against this. No profit, no payment.

## Simulation vs Reality <a href="#simulation-vs-reality" id="simulation-vs-reality" />

Some really smart people found weaknesses among all of these defenses.

The first defense was that simulation was done with an ERC20 transfer function that checked to see if the block was a mined by Flashbots' miners, and if so it transfers way less out. Local simulations look fine but do not work in production.

## The second defense - Payment only on a sell transaction <a href="#the-second-defense-payment-only-on-a-sell-transaction" id="the-second-defense-payment-only-on-a-sell-transaction" />

Again: Sandwich bots make miner payment conditional on profit. That was broken by making the ERC20 token pay the miner. Thus even with the Sandwich bot sell failing, the miner would still get paid!

Here's what actually happened: Sandwich bot gets baited and buys 100 ETH of the poisonous token. Poisonous token owner's bait triggers custom transfer function, which pays 0.1 ETH to the miner Sandwich bot's sell doesn't work because of the poisonous token. As the sandwich bot submitted these three transactions in a bundle all three were included: the successful buy, the bait, and the failed sell. The poisonous ERC20's payment via the custom transfer was what incentivized a miner to include it!

It is estimated that the first person to do this made about 100 ETH. You can see the poisoned ERC20 Uniswap transactions [here ](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe253a1f7d5818022661bfbd2cbe043b642b4eff9?a=0x01f8d5a4862d51d2cf0cf52ac900a4d60adaeee6).

## From Victim to Predator <a href="#from-victim-to-predator" id="from-victim-to-predator" />

One of their victims was one the most successful Flashbots bot operators, and they immediately sprung into action. In a short period of time the victim turned into an apex predator. They launched a similar but slightly different ERC20 (YOLOchain), and ended up successfully baiting many more sandwichers. They made 300 ETH doing so!


# Salmonella

## How It Works

Salmonella intentionally exploits the generalised nature of front-running setups. The goal of sandwich trading is to exploit the slippage of unintended victims, so this strategy turns the tables on the exploiters. It's a regular ERC20 token, which behaves exactly like any other ERC20 token in normal use-cases. However, it has some special logic to detect when anyone other than the specified owner is transacting it, and in these situations it only returns 10% of the specified amount - despite emitting event logs which match a trade of the full amount.

# Solutions

## Different approaches to tackling the MEV problem <a href="#different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem" id="different-approaches-to-tackling-the-mev-problem" />

There are largely 2 schools of thought when it comes to approaching the MEV problem

1. <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" style={{display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: '0.25rem'}} /> **Offense** - MEV is here to stay so let's find a way to extract and democratize it.
2. <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" width="32" height="32" style={{display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle', marginRight: '0.25rem'}} /> **Defense** - MEV is bad so let's try to prevent it.

Projects like Automata Network are in the Defense camp where the solution [Conveyor](https://docs.ata.network/mev/solutions/mev-minimization-prevention/#conveyor-the-automata-network-approach-to-tackling-mev) ingests transactions and outputs transactions in a determined order. This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.

To further explain, we have put different approaches into 3 categories:

# Arbitrage

## Definition

Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same asset in different markets in order to profit from differences in the asset's listed price.


# Automated Market Maker

## How AMMs Work

A type of Decentralised Exchange. Contrary to traditional limit order-book-based exchanges (which maintain a list of bids and asks for an asset pair), AMM exchanges maintain a pool of capital (a liquidity pool) with at least two assets. A smart contract governs the rules by which traders can purchase and sell assets from the liquidity pool. The most common AMM mechanism is a constant product AMM, where the product of an asset X and asset Y in a pool have to abide by a constant K.

Examples of AMM Exchanges include [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/), [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap).


# DeFi

## Definition

DeFi is a subset of finance-focused decentralized protocols that operate autonomously on blockchain-based smart contracts. The total value locked in DeFi amounts to >$50B USD[¹](https://defipulse.com/).

# Lending Platforms

## How Lending Platforms Work

Debt is an essential tool in DeFi. As DeFi applications typically operate without Know Your Customer (KYC), the borrower's debt must be over-collateralized. Hence, a borrower must collateralize (lock) 150% of the value that the borrower wishes to lend out. The collateral acts as a security to the lender if the borrower doesn't pay back the debt.

Examples of lending platforms include [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).

In Lending Platforms, if the collateral value decreases and the collateralization ratio falls below 150%, the collateral can be freed up for liquidation. Liquidators can then purchase the collateral at a discount to repay the debt.


# Priority Gas Auctions

## How PGAs Work

As pure arbitrage opportunities offer unconditional revenue, bots often compete against each other by bidding up transaction fees (gas) in PGAs which drives up fees for other users.


# Slippage

## Definition

Slippage is defined as the move in the price of a security between the time you decided to transact in it and the time your order was in the market. When performing a trade on an AMM, the expected execution price may differ from the real execution price because the expected price depends on a past blockchain state, which may change between the transaction creation and its execution — e.g., due to front-running transactions.


# Transaction Ordering

## Overview

Blockchains typically prescribe specific rules for consensus, but there are only loose requirements for miners on how to order transactions within a block. Many attacks are centered around how miners order transactions within blocks.


# EDEN Network (ArcherSwap)

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Eden Network (Previously ArcherSwap)

Eden Network is a new DEX extension for Uniswap and Sushiswap that prevents frontrunning and offers traders zero slippage and zero cost cancellation swaps. This enables users to set slippage tolerance to 0%. Miners will only be paid if "acceptance criteria" are met, so any transaction that fails is not included on chain.

One is for searchers to submit Flashbots-compatible bundles. The other is the Archer Relay Network (powers Archerswap) where users can submit private transactions and be protected from malicious MEV.

# BackBone Cabal

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />BackBone Cabal

BackBone Cabal is a strategy that aims to extract MEV from SushiSwap. Profits are redistributed back to users who submitted trades in the first place in the form of eliminating their transaction cost (up to 90%).

YCabal creates a virtualized mempool (i.e. a MEV-relay network) that aggregates transactions (batching).

Users are able to opt in and send transactions to YCabal and in return for not having to pay for gas for their transaction, YCabal batch processes it and takes the arbitrage profit. Risk by inventory price risk is carried by a Vault, where Vault depositers are returned the profit the YCabal realizes.

BackRunMe is a service that allows users to submit private transactions (e.g. protection against frontrunning and sandwich attacks) while allowing searchers to backrun the transaction via MEV IF it produces an arbitrage profit. If it doesn't generate an arbitrage profit it is processed as a regular private transaction. BackRunMe, gives a portion of this additional profit back to the user.

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by MEV. They aim to Democratize MEV Extraction through MEV-Geth, which enables a sealed-bid block space auction mechanism for communicating transaction order preference.

</Callout>

Flashbots created an ETH node for miners, that not only watches the mempool like any other node, but also connects to a relayer (a server) operated by Flashbots. This MEV-Relay is a kind of parallel channel that directly connects miners to bots that want their transactions included.

The transactions that the bots want to include are sent through the MEV-Relay as bundles containing:

* the transactions to execute
* a tip to the miner, coming as an ETH transfer

These transactions use a 0 gwei gas price, as the payment to the miner is included in the transaction itself as the tip.

Since these transactions are sent through a parallel private relay, it reduces the mempool bidding war, failed transactions bloating the blockchain, and overall gas cost for users.

# Front-running as a Service (FaaS) or MEV Auctions (MEVA)

## Overview

In a FaaS or MEVA system, MEV is extracted in a variety of ways such as miners auctioning off the right to front-run users.

> Centralizing MEV extraction is good because it quarantines a revenue stream that could otherwise drive centralization in other sectors.
>

> In this article, I’m going to go deep into my personal arguments for why extracting MEV in cryptocurrencies isn’t like theft, why it is a critical metric for network security in any distributed system secured by economic incentives (yes, including centralized ones), and what we should do about MEV in the next 3-5 years as a community.

# KeeperDAO

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />KeeperDAO

KeeperDAO is similar to a mining pool for Keepers. By incentivizing a game theory optimal strategy for cooperation among on-chain arbitrageurs, KeeperDAO provides an efficient mechanism for large scale arbitrage and liquidation trades on all DeFi protocols.

### The Hiding Game <a href="#the-hiding-game" id="the-hiding-game" />

One of the 3 games that has been built. The Hiding Game refers to the cooperation between users and keepers to “hide” MEV by wrapping trades/debt in specialised on-chain contracts. These contracts restrict profit extracting opportunities to KeeperDAO itself.

### Here's the ELI5 <a href="#heres-the-eli5" id="heres-the-eli5" />

Users route their trades and loans through KeeperDAO, which attempts to extract any arbitrage or liquidation profit available. Those profits are returned back to the user in $ROOK tokens, and profits go into a pool controlled by $ROOK holders. By giving KeeperDAO priority access to arbitrage and liquidations, the Hiding Game maximizes the profits available from these opportunities.

### kCompound (Phase 2 of the Hiding Game) <a href="#kcompound-phase-2-of-the-hiding-game" id="kcompound-phase-2-of-the-hiding-game" />

kCompound is the second phase of the Hiding Game. KeeperDAO posts collateral to save your position from being publicly liquidated. Instead, you get privately liquidated. KeeperDAO keeper will then find the best price for your collateral, targeting a 5% profit margin. This profit will then be split between you, the keeper, and the KeeperDAO treasury, meaning that kCompound borrowers will receive a portion of the profits from their own liquidation.

# MiningDAO

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />MiningDAO

MiningDAO is building a decentralized and transparent protocol for block formation that aims to pass 100% of MEV to miners. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose the next block to be mined (via a block sealhash), and attach a bounty for successfully mining it. The mining pools would then mine on the highest-bounty proposal.

One is for searchers to submit Flashbots-compatible bundles. The other is the Archer Relay Network (powers Archerswap) where users can submit private transactions and be protected from malicious MEV.

<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />MistX by alchemist <a href="#mistx-by-alchemist" id="mistx-by-alchemist" />

mistX is a DEX that enables end users to send transactions through Flashbots bundles. All transactions are gasless. However, instead of paying gas to the miners mistX users pay miners a bribe/tip in ETH. The tip is either included in the trade or comes from the user's wallet.

The exchange utilises Flashbots and as such transactions processed via mistX do not publish user transaction information to a public mempool, but instead bundle transactions together. This hides the information from front-runners and thus prevents transactions from being manipulated, front-run, or sandwiched.

# Optimism



<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Optimism

Optimism are the original proposers of MEVA.

MEV Auction (MEVA) is created in which the winner of the auction has the right to reorder submitted transactions and insert their own, as long as they do not delay any specific transaction by more than N blocks.

<figure>
    <img alt="MEVA on Ethereum" src={__img0} placeholder="blur" />
  <figcaption>MEVA on Ethereum</figcaption>
</figure>

### Implementing the Auction <a href="#implementing-the-auction" id="implementing-the-auction" />

The auction is able to extract MEV from miners by separating two functions 1) Transaction inclusion; and 2) transaction ordering. In order to implement MEVA roles are defined. **Block producers** determine transaction inclusion, and **Sequencers** determine transaction ordering.

### Block producers - Transaction Inclusion <a href="#block-producers-transaction-inclusion" id="block-producers-transaction-inclusion" />

Block proposers are most analogous to traditional blockchain miners. Instead of proposing blocks with an ordering, they simply propose a set of transactions to eventually be included before N blocks.

### Sequencers - Transaction Ordering <a href="#sequencers-transaction-ordering" id="sequencers-transaction-ordering" />

Sequencers are elected by a smart contract managed auction run by the block producers called the MEVA contract. This auction assigns the right to sequence the last N transactions. If, within a timeout the sequencer has not submitted an ordering which is included by block proposers, a new sequencer is elected.

### Implementation on Layer 2 <a href="#implementation-on-layer-2" id="implementation-on-layer-2" />

It is possible to enshrine this MEVA contract directly on layer 1 (L1) blockchain consensus protocols. However, it is also possible to non-invasively add this mechanism in layer 2 (L2) and use it to manage Optimistic Rollup transactio ordering. In L2, L1 miners are repurposed and utilized as block proposers. MEVA contract is implemented and designated a single sequencer at a time.

# Private Transactions



<br />

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-offense-faas.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Private Transactions

Typically, transactions are broadcast to the mempool where they remain pending until miners pick them and add to the block. Private transactions however, are only visible to the pool and are not broadcast to other nodes (pay more for faster transactions).

Examples include [1inch Exchange's Stealth Transactions](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/4695716-what-are-stealth-transactions-and-how-they-work), [Taichi Network](https://taichi.network/) and[ BloXroute](https://bloxroute.com/products/).

Taichi Network allows users to send private transactions directly to [Sparkpool,](https://www.sparkpool.com/en/) bypassing the public *mempool.*

    <img alt="Private Transactions offered by Taichi Network" src={__img0} placeholder="blur" />

[bloXroute Labs](https://bloxroute.com/) has a wide range of offerings and their core competency is low global latency for DeFi (8% of blocks mined within 1 sec).

<Callout type="warn">
  For the other side of the coin, here is bloXroute Labs' take on why private mempools are not necessarily bad[¹](https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/frontrunning-protection):

  1. Front-runners don't need these services to outpace regular users, who are slower by seconds. They need it to outpace one another, where improving speed 0.8->0.15 sec matters.
  2. When a transaction is privately sent to pools other frontrunners can't attempt to front-run it. This helps avoid fierce escalation of fees.

# Arbitrum (Offchain Labs)

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Arbitrum by Offchain Labs

### Arbitrum is against MEVA and FaaS.

3 Modes of Arbitrum:

1. **Single Sequencer: L2 MEV-Potential (*****Mainnet Beta*****)**

   For Arbitrum’s initial, flagship Mainnet beta release, the Sequencer will be controlled by a single entity. This entity has transaction ordering rights within the narrow / 15 minute window; users are trusting the Sequencer not to frontrun them.
2. **Distributed Sequencer With Fair Ordering: L2-MEV-minimized (*****Mainnet Final Form*****)**

   The Arbitrum flagship chain will eventually have a distributed set of independent parties controlling the Sequencer. They will collectively propose state updates via [the first BFT algorithm that enforces fair ordering within consensus (Aequitas)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf). Here, L2 MEV is only possible if >1/3 of the sequencing-parties maliciously collude, hence “MEV-minimized.”
3. **No Sequencer: No L2 MEV**

   A chain can be created in which no permissioned entities have Sequencing rights. Ordering is determined entirely by the Inbox contract; lose the ability to get lower latency than L1, but gain is that no party involved in L2, including Arbitrum validators, has any say in transaction ordering, and thus no L2 MEV enters the picture.

# Conveyor (Automata Network)



## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Conveyor - The Automata Network approach to tackling MEV

At Automata, we have created **Conveyor**, a service that ingests and outputs transactions in a determined order. This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.

<img alt="" src={__img0} placeholder="blur" />

When transactions are fed into Conveyor, it determines the order of the incoming transactions and makes it impossible for block producers to perform the following:

1. Inject new transactions into the Conveyor output: The inserted transactions bypassing Conveyor is detectable by anyone because of signature mismatch.
2. Delete ordered transactions: Transactions accepted by Conveyor are broadcasted everywhere so transactions cannot be deleted unless ALL block producers are colluding and censoring the transactions at the same time.

From the DEX’s perspective, they can choose to accept either

1. Ordered transactions from Automata’s Conveyor which is free from transaction reordering and other front-running transactions
2. Other unordered transactions (which include front-running etc) that may negatively impact their users

#### Why should users trust Conveyor? <a href="#why-should-users-trust-conveyor" id="why-should-users-trust-conveyor" />

Automata’s Conveyor runs on a decentralized compute plane backed by many Geode instances. Each Geode instance can be attested so anyone can publicly verify that the Geode is running on a system with genuine hardware (i.e., CPU) and that the Geode application code matches the version that is open-sourced and audited. This provides a strong guarantee that:

* The Geode code is untampered with
* The Geode data is inaccessible to even Geode providers (In which case they cannot act on said data to front-run transactions)

Importantly, Automata’s Conveyor is a chain-agnostic solution to the MEV issue, and works seamlessly on various platforms — zero modifications needed.

#### An industry-first: Oblivious RAM <a href="#an-industry-first-oblivious-ram" id="an-industry-first-oblivious-ram" />

In fully public computation, access pattern leakage is not negligible as everything is exposed. But in privacy-preserving computation, any tiny bit of information leakage becomes a significant issue. Studies have shown that access pattern leakage leads to exposure of sensitive information such as private keys from searchable encryption and trusted computing.

This is where the Oblivious RAM algorithm comes into play. Automata’s implementation is the first-of-its-kind in the blockchain industry, providing an exceedingly high degree of privacy in dApps.

This greatly reduces the probability of user privacy being leaked even as access patterns are being monitored and analyzed by malicious actors. The Automata team has authored multiple research papers on state-of-the-art ORAM and hardware technologies to enhance the privacy and performance of existing networks.

A collaboration between BalancerLabs and Gnosis, CowSwap is a DEX that leverages batch auctions to provide MEV protection, plus integrate with liquidity sources across DEXs to offer traders the best prices. When two traders each hold an asset the other wants, an order can be settled directly between them without an external market maker or liquidity provider. Any excess is settled in the same transaction with the best available AMM. The transaction is sent by professional “solvers” which set tight slippage bounds. Solvers compete with each other to achieve best prices for the user.

# Fair sequencing service (Chainlink)

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />The Fair Sequencing Service by ChainLink

The idea behind FSS is to have an oracle network order the transactions sent to a particular contract SC, including both user transactions and oracle reports. Oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it.

FSS is a framework for implementing ordering policies, of which [Aequitas](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf) (protocol for order-fairness in addition to consistency and liveness) is one example. It can alternatively support simpler approaches, such as straightforward encryption of transactions, which can then be decrypted in a threshold manner by oracle nodes after ordering. It will also support various policies for inserting oracle reports into a stream of transactions. (It can even support MEV auctions, if desired.)

# SecretSwap (Secret Network)

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Secret Swap

Secret Swap is an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity protocol. There is no orderbook, no centralized party, and no central facilitator of trade. Using Secret Contracts, the mempool of potential Secret Swap transactions are kept entirely encrypted - protecting users from MEV, front-running attacks and providing an increased level of privacy compared to traditional AMMs.

The protocol uses swap secret contract based tokens (SNIP-20s) on Secret Network. Given the encrypted nature of SNIP-20s secret contracts, inputs to a transaction/contract are encrypted while they are on the mempool and cannot be front-run by any adversary. Users will have to pay for gas and 0.3% swap fees with the $SCRT token to use Secret Swap.

# Shutter Network

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Shutter Network

Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent frontrunning and malicious MEV on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.

A Shutter transaction is a transaction protected from frontrunning in the target smart contract system. It therefore passes through a sequence of stages before it is executed.

A Shutter transaction flow:

1. Created and encrypted in the user's wallet;
2. Sent to the batcher contract as a standard Ethereum transaction;
3. Picked up and decrypted by the keypers;
4. Sent to the executor contract, and
5. Forwarded to the target contract.

Sikka's MEV solution to censorship and frontrunning problems is using a technique called Threshold Decryption, as a plugin to the Tendermint Core BFT consensus engine to create mempool level privacy. With this plugin, users are able to submit encrypted transactions to the blockchain, which are only decrypted and executed after being committed to a block by a quorum of 2/3 validators.

# Veedo (StarkWare)

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Veedo by StarkWare

VeeDo is StarkWare’s STARK-based Verifiable Delay Function (VDF), and its PoC is now live on Mainnet. VeeDo's time-locks allow information to be sealed for a predetermined period of time (during the sequencing phase), and then made public.

2 approaches using privacy to minimize MEV

1. Time-locks as part of the protocol layer
2. Time-locks on Ethereum with smart contracts - supported today

# Vega protocol

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-defense-shield.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" />Vega Protocol

Traditionally, fairness in a blockchain has been defined in absolute terms, i.e. once a transaction is seen by a sufficient number of validators, it will be executed in some block, soon. Vega's proposal is to add a module to blockchains that supports the concept of relative fairness so that competing transactions may be sequenced under a known and understood protocol, and not subject to a validator’s discretion.

"*If there is a time t such that all honest validators saw a before t and b after t, then a must be scheduled before b”.* This is a property that can be assured of at any time with a minimal impact on performance.

To get the best combination, their current approach is a hybrid of the two. In normal operation, the protocol will assure block fairness. If the network detects that this causes a bottleneck, it temporarily switches to the timed approach (thus sacrificing a little fairness for performance), before switching back once the bottleneck is resolved. However, Vega will ultimately make the level of fairness customisable by market.

# B.Protocol

## <img src="/mev-wiki/images/icon-bprotocol.png" alt="" className="heading-icon" /> B.Protocol <a href="#bprotocol" id="bprotocol" />

B.Protocol aims to shift MEV to users.

Users interact with existing lending platforms via B.Protocol smart contract. Liquidity providers (LP) provide a cushion to user debt, which gives B.Protocol precedence over other liquidators. LPs share their profits with the users, where user reward is proportional to his user rating.
