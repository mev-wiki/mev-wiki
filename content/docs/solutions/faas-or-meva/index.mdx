description: MEVA and FaaS solutions.

## Overview

In a FaaS or MEVA system, MEV is extracted in a variety of ways such as miners auctioning off the right to front-run users.

> Centralizing MEV extraction is good because it quarantines a revenue stream that could otherwise drive centralization in other sectors.

> In this article, I’m going to go deep into my personal arguments for why extracting MEV in cryptocurrencies isn’t like theft, why it is a critical metric for network security in any distributed system secured by economic incentives (yes, including centralized ones), and what we should do about MEV in the next 3-5 years as a community.
