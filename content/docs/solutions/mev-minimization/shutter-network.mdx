Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent frontrunning and malicious MEV on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.

A Shutter transaction is a transaction protected from frontrunning in the target smart contract system. It therefore passes through a sequence of stages before it is executed.

A Shutter transaction flow:

1. Created and encrypted in the user's wallet;
2. Sent to the batcher contract as a standard Ethereum transaction;
3. Picked up and decrypted by the keypers;
4. Sent to the executor contract, and
5. Forwarded to the target contract.
